# Slinky

I used to love my Slingbox back in the day. They killed it over and over (ads, web client, ...), and finally killed it for good by shutting down the servers.

I've long wanted to build my own replacement and this is kind of step #1. More documentation will come as it's far from feature complete - it's mostly a UI for the remote control at the moment (the hardware hasn't arrived for me to integrate the video piece).

## Dependencies

1. [Logitch Harmony Hub](https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/products.html) - this controls the remote, activities etc
2. [Harmony API](https://github.com/maddox/harmony-api) - a REST API to control the Harmony hub
3. [URayCoder HD](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07D78L3SZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00) or similar product that streams H.264/H.265 video

## Setup

TBD - still working on getting it working
